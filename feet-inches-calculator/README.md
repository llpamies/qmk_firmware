# Feet &amp; Inches Calculator

Paste any text that contains a feet-and-inches measurement, give it a length to add
or subtract, and get your text back with only the measurement changed.

```
I am 6ft, 3in and 1/2 tall     + 1/2 in    →    I am 6ft, 4in tall
The beam is 5'-6" long         + 3 1/2 in  →    The beam is 5'-9 1/2" long
Cut the 8 ft 0 in stud to fit  − 3 1/4 in  →    Cut the 7 ft 8 3/4 in stud to fit
```

## Why

Most feet-and-inch calculators make you disassemble your measurement into separate
feet / inches / numerator / denominator boxes, then hand you back a number you have
to retype into whatever you were actually writing. This one takes the sentence you
already have and edits it in place.

## What it understands

| | |
|---|---|
| Notations | `6ft 3in`, `6' 3"`, `5'-6"`, `6 feet 3 inches`, `6 ft. 3 in.`, `5’ 6”`, `5' 6''` |
| Without spaces | `6ft3in`, `12ft6in`, `5'6"` — and a number glued to a feet mark is inches, so `5'6` and `6ft2` work too |
| Numbers | integers, decimals (`6.5 ft`, `.5 in`), fractions (`1/2 in`), mixed (`3 1/2 in`) |
| Scattered parts | `6ft, 3in and 1/2` reads as one measurement of 6&nbsp;ft&nbsp;3½&nbsp;in |
| Surrounding prose | `Order 3 of the 6 ft 2 in posts` reads as 6&nbsp;ft&nbsp;2&nbsp;in — the `3` is left alone |

Two rules keep it honest:

- **Exactly one measurement per box.** If a box holds more than one, the app names
  both and refuses to guess. `an 8 ft wall and a 3 ft door` is an error, not a
  coin flip.
- **A bare number only counts in the Amount box**, where it means inches. In the
  text box a number needs a unit before it is treated as a measurement, so ordinary
  numbers in your prose are never swallowed.

Your notation is echoed back: feed it `5'-6"` and the answer is `5'-9 1/2"`, not
`5 ft 9.5 in`. The tick marks, the spacing, the separator, and whether you used feet
at all are all preserved. Results round to a fraction you pick, from ½" to ¹⁄₆₄".

## Running it

It is three static files and no dependencies — no build step, no bundler, no
framework. Open `index.html` directly, or serve the folder:

```sh
python3 -m http.server
```

## Tests

```sh
node test/lengths.test.js                                     # parser + formatter
NODE_PATH=/path/to/global/node_modules node test/browser.smoke.js   # UI, needs playwright
```

`lengths.js` is loadable both as a browser script and as a Node module, so the same
code backs the page and the tests.

## How it works

`lengths.js` is the whole engine, in three stages:

1. **Tokenize** — scan for `number + optional unit`, where a number may be an
   integer, decimal, fraction, or mixed number.
2. **Group** — merge adjacent tokens into one measurement when only separators sit
   between them (`, `, ` and `, `-`, `. `). Anything else ends the measurement, which
   is what makes `an 8 ft wall and a 3 ft door` two measurements rather than one.
   A unitless token joins its neighbour only if it is a bare fraction, which is how
   `3in and 1/2` works without `Order 3 of the...` breaking.
3. **Format** — render the result using the marks and spacing captured from the
   input.

Measurements are held as exact rational numbers of inches rather than floats, so
sixteenths stay sixteenths no matter how many edits you stack up.
